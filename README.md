# IMDB_reviews_NLP
In this repository we will be exploring the IMDB dataset https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/, which is a inbuilt data set in Tensorflow Data Services. 

The data is split into 25000 samples each for testing and training.  

The goal is to create a "Embedding" for the reviews, here words and associated words are clustered as vectors in a multi-dimensional space. 

The reviews will be of two categories positive and negative


Sample results:

We can the nearest words related to the input word "unwatchable", which is a word often seen in bad reviews
